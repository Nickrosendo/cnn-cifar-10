## CNN implementation using pytorch and CIFAR-10 dataset.


### Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
### Run jupyter notebook `jupyter-notebook`
### Open `cnn-cifar-10.ipynb` notebook
### Run all cells from the notebook 

***Is recommended to install dependencies and run the notebook with a virtual environment. For more information on how to create a virtual env, check the documentation: [link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)***


***For 30 series GPUs is required to install a different version of pytorch,
for more info access their documentation: [link](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)***
